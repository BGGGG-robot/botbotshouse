They were the last people you‚Äôd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn‚Äôt hold with such nonsense. Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn‚Äôt think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley‚Äôs sister, but they hadn‚Äôt met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn‚Äôt have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn‚Äôt want Dudley mixing with a child like that";
